### Abstract
This a portfolio project and my main goal was to combine my knowledge of both SQL and Tableau. I started off by finding a dataset on Kaggle. After importing the dataset into BigQuery and structuring the data according to my requirements, I proceeded to transfer it to Tableau for the purpose of creating visualizations.

### Background 
It is 2018 and I am a entry level data analyis and I am assigned to the company "ABC Developers" a new and up and coming developers. After some questioning I realized what they were asking for. **"A dashboard to better help them understand the console market and the impact of their decisions both globally and regionally"**
I also come to the conclusions that the most immportant decsions for any developers would be : console exclusivity and the genere of their games.
